**Note**
Kernel versions 6.10 ‚Äê 6.18 include an earlier version of this module (TGRIP-16EX and TGRIP-18 only).

**Note**
Kernel 6.19 is going to have the full version, I think it's going to be released at the end of January 2026.

# linux-winwing
Linux kernel module for [WinWing](https://winwingsim.com/) Orion2 throttle base with the following grip handles:

  * TGRIP-15E
  * TGRIP-15EX
  * TGRIP-16EX
  * TGRIP-18

On the Orion 2 throttle, numbers 0 .. 63 are reserved for buttons on the throttle grip; the throttle base buttons have numbers 64 .. 110.
Some of the throttle base buttons don't work with Linux because the kernel HID subsystem only supports up to 80 buttons without special kernel modules.

TGRIP-16EX, TGRIP-18: Unused button numbers 33 .. 64 are not mapped.

TGRIIP-15E, TGRIP-15EX: Buttons 17 .. 44 are maped to KEY_MACRO1 .. KEY_MACRO28.
